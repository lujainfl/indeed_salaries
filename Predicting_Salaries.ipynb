    "Indeed job postings website data has been scraped for a list of major cities with search key words (data scientist). The features collected for each posting included the title, location, salary, and company name. more than 17000 observations were collected, however only 400 could be using for analysis because they included yearly salary (our target variable). Each location (metro area) searched were treated as an individual feature, as well as some key words contained in the title such as manager, sr, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to model the behavior of salary in relation to the other feature, many ML classification algorithms were used, such Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. However, the simplest one, Logistic Regression, actually performed better overall achieving an accuracy score of 0.70. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitation to the taken approach including not taking into account more keyword features in the title, though I chose not to to avoid over fitting (over optimizing as in the model scores well on the data available but is not new data). Other limitations in the approach is using only the metro area to predict instead of the actual location (city and state), perhaps some states jobs have higher salaries because of some specific state laws which would be hard to model in interstate cities such as Washington DC (VA and MD), New York City (NY, NJ), and so on. Lastly, the number of observations (400) is really small considering the actual number of job postings on indeed, let alone actual vacancies in real life. In the future, we can scrape more than one job posting platform website or incorporate the hourly rate into the dataset. "
